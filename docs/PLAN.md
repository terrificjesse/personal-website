# Fridge App — Phased Implementation Plan

Legend for each task:
- **[gen]** — fine for Claude Code to generate fully.
- **[learn]** — flagged learning area (auth / NLP / recommendations). Claude should scaffold
  the surrounding structure and stop at the boundary; the user implements the core logic.
  See `CLAUDE.md` → Learning Mode.
- **[you]** — decisions or setup only the user should do (accounts, keys, preferences).

---

## Phase 0 — Repo & environment setup (do this before Phase 1)

- [gen] `frontend/`: `create-next-app` with TypeScript + Tailwind + App Router.
- [gen] `apps/fridge-app/backend/`: `cargo init`, add `axum`, `tokio`, `serde`,
  `serde_json`, `sqlx` (sqlite driver to start — fast local dev, swap to Postgres later
  if you want that experience too).
- [gen] Basic health-check endpoint (`GET /health`) and a root Next.js page that fetches
  it, just to prove the two sides talk to each other.
- [you] Decide: SQLite for the whole project, or Postgres from the start? SQLite is less
  setup and is plenty for a single-user app; Postgres is more realistic if you want that
  experience. Either is fine — flag your choice so it goes in this doc.
- [gen] `.gitignore`, basic `README.md`, initialize git repo, first commit.

## Phase 1 — Fridge core + NLP item matching

**Goal:** CRUD for fridge items, expiration projection, typo/synonym-tolerant item
identity ("tomato" == "tomatoes" == "tomatoe").

### Backend (Rust)
- [gen] Data model: `FridgeItem { id, canonical_name, quantity, unit, added_at,
  estimated_expiration }`.
- [gen] Migrations + `sqlx` queries for add/remove/list items.
- [gen] Endpoint skeletons: `POST /items`, `DELETE /items/:id`, `GET /items`,
  `PATCH /items/:id`.
- [learn] **Item name normalization** — when a new item is added, decide whether it matches
  an existing canonical item (or a known dictionary entry) despite typos/pluralization.
  Claude will stub a trait, e.g. `fn resolve_item_name(input: &str, known: &[String]) ->
  MatchResult`, and write tests against it (exact match, plural, common typo, unrelated
  word → no match). You implement the body. Worth researching before you start: edit
  distance (Levenshtein/Damerau-Levenshtein), simple stemming for plurals, and whether a
  small local synonym dictionary is more practical than a "smart" algorithm for a
  single-user fridge app.
- [learn] **Expiration projection** — reclassified as a learning area at the user's
  request (originally scoped as [gen]). Claude stubs `fn estimate_expiration(item_name:
  &str, added_at: DateTime<Utc>) -> DateTime<Utc>` with tests (produce vs. pantry vs. dairy
  category gets a materially different shelf life; unknown item gets a sane fallback
  rather than panicking). You implement the body — a category → shelf-life lookup table is
  a perfectly good starting point, no need to overengineer it.

### Frontend (Next.js)
- [gen] `/fridge` tab route, item list view, add-item form, remove button, expiration
  badges (color-coded by days remaining).
- [gen] API client hooks (`useFridgeItems`, etc.) wired to the Rust backend.

### Checkpoint
You should be able to add "tomatoe", have it resolve to "tomato", see it in the list with
a projected expiration date, and remove it.

---

## Phase 2 — Shopping list + purchase-based recommendations

**Goal:** A shopping list you can add to manually, plus suggested items based on purchase
history and near-expiry fridge items. Non-grocery items excluded from recommendation logic.

### Backend
- [gen] Data model: `ShoppingListItem { id, name, is_grocery: bool, added_manually: bool,
  status }` and `PurchaseHistory { item_name, purchased_at, quantity }` (populate purchase
  history when an item is marked "bought" off the list, or when a fridge item is added —
  decide which trigger makes more sense as you build it).
- [gen] Endpoints for add/remove/list shopping list items, mark-purchased.
- [learn] **Recommendation logic** for "what to add to the shopping list" — Claude stubs
  `fn suggest_shopping_items(history: &[PurchaseHistory], fridge: &[FridgeItem]) ->
  Vec<Suggestion>` with tests (e.g. "item purchased weekly and not in fridge → suggested",
  "item expiring in <2 days → suggested as replacement"). You implement it. Worth reading
  about before starting: simple frequency/recency heuristics are a legitimate starting
  point — you don't need ML here. This is a good phase to learn the difference between
  a rules-based recommender and a learned one, since Phase 4 will push you toward the
  latter.
- [gen] Non-grocery items: just a boolean flag that excludes them from the history table
  and suggestion input — no learning content here, straightforward filtering.

### Frontend
- [gen] Shopping list tab/section, add/remove UI, "suggested items" panel (separate from
  the manual list), grocery vs. non-grocery toggle on add.

### Checkpoint
Mark a few fridge items as purchased over a couple of simulated "weeks" (you can backdate
test data), confirm suggestions reflect frequency and expiring items, confirm a
non-grocery item (e.g. "paper towels") never shows up as a suggestion.

## Phase 3 — Recipe recommendations

**Goal:** Recipes recommended from fridge + shopping list contents, with cook time,
required appliances, extra ingredients (spices etc.), and typed filters (cuisine,
meal type).

- [gen] This phase is not flagged as a learning area — Claude can generate most of it.
- [gen] Data model: `Recipe { id, name, cuisine_tags, meal_type_tags, cook_time_minutes,
  required_appliances, fridge_ingredients, extra_ingredients }`.
- [gen] Decide + document a recipe data source: seed a local JSON/DB of recipes to start
  (simplest, no API keys) vs. an external recipe API (more coverage, needs a key/rate
  limits). Recommend starting with a seeded local set (~30-50 recipes across a few
  cuisines) so Phase 4's review system has something to attach to quickly.
- [gen] Matching logic: score/filter recipes by how many required ingredients are already
  in fridge+shopping list, then apply the user's typed filters (cuisine/meal type) as a
  hard filter, not a scoring input — keeps it predictable and easy to reason about.
- [gen] Endpoints: `GET /recipes/recommended?cuisine=&mealType=`.
- [gen] Frontend: recipe cards showing cook time, appliances, extra ingredients needed,
  filter chips/dropdown for cuisine and meal type.

### Checkpoint
Filtering by a cuisine returns only recipes tagged with it; recipes using more of your
current fridge contents show up first.

---

## Phase 4 — Review system + learned recommendation

**Goal:** Rate past recipes; liked recipes resurface (in a separate "recommended again"
section); disliked ones stop appearing; review history is browsable.

- [gen] Data model: `Review { recipe_id, rating, cooked_at, notes }`.
- [gen] Endpoints: submit review, list review history.
- [gen] Frontend: review form after marking a recipe "cooked," a review history page, and
  a second recommendation section ("Recipes you liked") separate from Phase 3's general
  recommendations.
- [learn] **The actual re-ranking algorithm** is the centerpiece learning goal of this
  phase. Claude stubs `fn rerank_recommendations(candidates: &[Recipe], reviews: &[Review])
  -> Vec<Recipe>` with tests describing desired behavior (liked recipe ranks higher on
  repeat suggestion, disliked recipe suppressed, unreviewed recipe unaffected). You
  implement it. This is intentionally the deepest algorithmic phase — good things to
  research before writing code: explicit-feedback recommenders, simple weighted scoring
  (rating × recency decay) as a first pass, and only reach for anything ML-flavored
  (e.g. a basic collaborative-filtering-style similarity score, if you add multiple users
  later) once the simple version feels limiting. Claude can discuss these approaches with
  you and review your implementation, but default to not writing it for you.

### Checkpoint
Rate a recipe highly, confirm it appears in the "liked" section on next recommendation;
rate one poorly, confirm it drops out of general recommendations.

---

## Phase 5 — Authentication

**Goal:** Password-based accounts, optional Google OAuth. Single user in practice, but
built for real.

- [gen] Claude can scaffold the *shape* of this: user table/migration, route structure
  (`/api/auth/register`, `/login`, `/logout`, session/cookie plumbing on the Next.js side,
  protected-route middleware), and can explain concepts (password hashing algorithms,
  session vs. JWT tradeoffs, OAuth flow steps) at a conceptual level.
- [learn] **The actual auth implementation** — password hashing/verification (e.g. with
  `argon2`), session issuance and validation, and the Google OAuth flow — is flagged as a
  learning area. You implement it; Claude reviews and helps debug rather than writing it
  wholesale. This is the highest-stakes learning area to get hands-on with, since auth
  bugs are the most common source of real vulnerabilities — take the time.
- [you] Register a Google Cloud OAuth client ID/secret yourself (Claude cannot create
  external accounts or credentials on your behalf); store secrets in `.env`, never commit
  them.

### Checkpoint
Register an account with a password, log out, log back in; connect Google as an alternate
login method; confirm fridge/shopping/recipe data is scoped to your account (even though
you're the only user, verify the scoping actually works — e.g. a fresh second test account
sees an empty fridge).

## After Phase 5

Not planned in detail yet: additional site tabs beyond the fridge app, deployment
(Vercel for `frontend/`, a small VPS or fly.io for the Rust backend + DB are reasonable
starting points), and whether Postgres replaces SQLite if you started there. Revisit once
Phase 5 is stable.
